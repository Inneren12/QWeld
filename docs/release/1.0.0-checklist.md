# 1.0.0 Release Checklist — Validation Notes

- ✅ Blueprint validator must be executed via `scripts/validate-blueprint.sh`; the script ensures Ajv CLI is installed locally and runs without `npx`.
- ✅ CI requires Node.js 20 LTS (configured via `actions/setup-node@v4`) to keep the validator workflow deterministic.
