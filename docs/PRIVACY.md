# QWeld Privacy Policy (Draft)

_Last updated: 2024-__-__ (update before release)_

QWeld respects your privacy. This draft policy summarises how the Android app handles data today. Update the effective date and sections before every public release.

## What we collect
- **Account identifiers**: email address when you sign in with an email-based provider.
- **Diagnostics**: crash reports via Firebase Crashlytics and anonymous usage analytics via Firebase Analytics (only if the user opts in through Settings).
- **Local study data**: practice attempts, answers and progress stored locally on your device.

## Why we collect it
- **Account identifiers** are required to authenticate you and keep your progress in sync across devices (future feature).
- **Diagnostics** help us detect crashes, measure performance and prioritise bug fixes.
- **Local study data** is needed to run offline practice sessions, personalise question queues and show history.

## How we use it
- Crash and analytics data is processed by Google Firebase on our behalf and accessed by the QWeld team for quality improvements only.
- We do not sell or share personal data with advertisers or third parties.
- Local study data stays on your device. It is removed if you clear attempts in Settings or uninstall the app.

## Retention
- Crash and analytics events are retained in Firebase for up to 14 months, subject to Firebase defaults.
- Authentication identifiers are stored until you delete your account or request removal (implement removal before production release).
- Local practice attempts remain on your device until you delete them via Settings or uninstall the app.

## Your rights
- You can disable analytics at any time in Settings → Privacy.
- Request access or deletion of your account data by contacting the team at the email below.
- If you are located in a region with specific privacy rights (e.g., GDPR, PIPEDA), we will respond within the required timeframe.
